<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Rinky Yadav. I have graduated from Delhi University and I am
  currently pursuing my MCA (Master of Computer Applications) degree.
</p>
<p>
  I have a great interest in web development and I am proficient in various
  technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. With my knowledge
  of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am able to create and design websites. HTML,
  which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, allows me to structure the content
  of web pages. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, enables me to style and present
  web pages in an appealing manner. JavaScript is a powerful programming
  language that adds interactivity and functionality to websites, making them
  dynamic and engaging.

  Additionally, I am familiar with Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that
  simplifies the process of building responsive and mobile-friendly websites. By
  utilizing Bootstrap's pre-designed components and templates, I am able to
  create professional-looking websites efficiently.

  I am constantly honing my web development skills and staying up to date with
  the latest industry trends, as the field is constantly evolving. I believe
  that my combination of skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap provides
  me with a strong foundation to excel in web development. Currently, I am
  pursuing my MCA degree to further expand my knowledge and expertise in
  computer applications. I am excited about the endless possibilities in the
  field of web development and I am eager to contribute my skills to create
  innovative and user-friendly web experiences.
